### Project Title
UPdate Carbon Footprint Tracker

### Project Overview
The UPdate web application, developed for the University of the Philippines Open
University, is a user-friendly tool designed to help individuals measure and reduce their carbon
footprint. It is built using core web technologies—HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript
for interactivity, PHP for server-side processing, and MySQL for database management—
without the use of external frameworks.

By allowing real-time data input, the system enables users to log their daily activities and
calculate the corresponding carbon emissions. The application then provides immediate
feedback, indicating whether the user’s daily carbon footprint falls within the ideal threshold. If
the footprint exceeds the recommended limit, the system offers practical suggestions for
reducing emissions and promoting more eco-friendly habits.

Although UPdate is still in its early stages of development, plans are underway to
enhance its features. Future updates aim to include more activity metrics, graphical
representations of usage trends, and category-specific suggestions tailored to each user’s
carbon output. These improvements will support more accurate tracking and promote deeper
engagement with sustainability goals.
